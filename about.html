            <br><br>
            Hello there! My name is Connor and I currently reside in North Kingstown, RI. I am attending the Univeristy of
            Rhode Island and pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I enjoy programming, graphic design, figuring out ways to automate 
            tasks, hiking and surfing. I decided to return to school this year with the goal of kickstarting my career and improving my 
            overall knowledge of how computers think! I currently hold an Associates Degree in Network Communications and believe 
            that my background in system infrastructure will serve me well while I study programming and computer science.
            <br><br>
            If you would like to get in contact with me, you can do so <a href="mailto:connorbuckbee@my.uri.edu? subject=Wow! Can I hire you?!"> here! </a>

            This is from a camping trip I took with my wife to the Smoky Mountain National Park. We did a ton of hiking and 
            ate all sorts of good food!

            This photo was taken at the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. It is the second most popular tourist attraction in Ireland, 
            and also a recognisable landmark on the big screen. Some of the bigger and more recent movies filmed at the Cliffs of 
            Moher include Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Princess Bride!

            This is our bunny rabbit, Sunny! She's a mini-lop, which is her breed. She gets hot in the summer so we give her frozen water bottles 
            in socks to cool off. She is cage-free and a really great housepet.
